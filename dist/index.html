            <p class="description">
              I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> with 2 years of
              experience, specializing in <strong>web development</strong> and
              <strong>data science</strong>. I'm passionate about creating
              innovative solutions that merge technology and design. In my free
              time, I enjoy learning graphic design or working on fun projects
              that allow me to explore new technologies and hone my skills. I
              also have a youtube channel where I occasionally drop tech
              tutorials. I am looking for opportunities to challenge myself and
              evolve.

Additionally, the website was designed with support for two languages, English and Arabic, to cater to a wider audience. I was responsible for creating the website from scratch, ensuring that it was optimized for performance, responsive, and visually appealing.

              <p class="description">
                I built a smart waste detector using Flutter and YOLOv3. The detector encourages recycling by making it fun and engaging through gamification. It uses a camera to capture the waste item and YOLOv3 to determine the type of waste. The user is then prompted to dispose of the item in the appropriate bin and earns points for doing so correctly. I designed the user interface to be easy to use and integrated cutting-edge technology to make the project more effective. Overall, the smart waste detector is an innovative solution that promotes recycling and makes a positive impact on the environment.

                A research based project where my team and I developed a YOLO based weapon detector which was then compared to the state of art models. The dataset was created by collecting images of weapons and annotating them through a tool. Different type of models were tested and applied, YOLO performed the best out of all.

                A very popular board game in my home country "Ludo", is created in Java for desktop. The game is built through perfecting the UI of the ludo board and then the rules of the game were implemented in the game. It was an academic project during my bachelors and it was awarded the best project by the instructor of that course.

              <p class="description">
                CPU scheduling algorithms were implemented in C++. There are different types of CPU scheduling algorithms and all have there own way of handling processes. I implemented the algorithms in C++ to visualize how these algorithms will work, this project was part of my course on Operating Systems.
